# Option-Critic-Turing-Machines

A development toybox and pitch for integrating the option-critic architecture with neural turing machines.

We investigate/present Option-Critic and Neural Turing Machines. We then relate the two and dicuss possible options of how they can be used together. As discussed, no code has been implemented yet for Option-Critic NTMs for the context of the assignment, but we hope to use this repository as a starting point for formulating the problem, gathering related work and proposing a possible formulation for a solution. 


If you decide to pursue this idea, please reach out to me first so we can collaborate on it. Thanks!
